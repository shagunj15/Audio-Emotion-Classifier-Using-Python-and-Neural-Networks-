# Audio-Emotion-Classifier-Using-Python-and-Neural-Networks <br>
• Implemented three neural network models, based on 1D CNN, LSTM, and Transformers using Mel
Spectrograms and MFCC as feature extractors<br>
• Trained the models separately for males and females as they have different physiologic and
acoustic features<br>
• Plays a vital role in human-machine interfaces (HMI) and essential in making an aware AI, but for
better classification other factors such as age should also be considered<br><br>
Please look at the report for more details. <br><br>
